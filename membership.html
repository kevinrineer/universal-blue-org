                            <p>New contributors should be welcomed to the community by existing members,
                                helped with PR workflow, and directed to relevant documentation and
                                communication channels. 
                            </p>
                            <p>This informal level is designed for drive-by contributors or those who might be 
                                interested in participating in open source and using this project to learn how.
                            </p>
                            <p>We encourage anyone to participate, and for those who wish to earn more responsibilities 
                                and begin their open source journey with us ... apply within. Vegeta tests us all.

                            <p>Since Universal Blue is meant to be a toolkit, we strive to generate fun experiments. 
                                Our example for this our collaboration with Cassidy James Blaede on GNOME Beyond, where
                                Cassidy is given direct Approver role of that repository along with our maintainers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>We hope to continue this trend, in the hopes that it spreads the cloud native desktop pattern
                                to as many projects that want to take advantage of it.

                            <p>Established community members are expected to demonstrate their adherence to the
                                principles in this document, familiarity with project organization, roles,
                                policies, procedures, conventions, etc., and technical and/or writing ability.
                                Role-specific expectations, responsibilities, and requirements are enumerated
                                below.

                            <p>In places where the project has a strong need for expertise in an area that lacks contributors, Approvers may make exceptions to grant elevated review permissions to underserved areas of the project. This is determined by lazy concensus of at least three Approvers.  </p>

                            <p>Members are <em>[continuously active]</em> contributors in the community. They can have

                                remain active contributors to the community. This role includes responsiblities 
                                that are defined as &quot;Reviewers&quot; in other cloud native projects.

                                compatibility, subtle performance and correctness issues, alignment with upstream

                                they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.
